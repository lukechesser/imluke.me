# [imluke.me](http://imluke.me/)

## Description

Custom build for my personal site and blog, [imluke.me](http://imluke.me/), using [Bastian Allgeier's](https://github.com/bastianallgeier) file-based CMS [Kirby](http://getkirby.com). The blog's backend is built off of [Sascha Lack's](https://github.com/sashtown) [Baseblog Kirby Theme](https://github.com/sashtown/Baseblog-Kirby-Theme) template.

## Details

This repo contains all of the content files (articles, links, projects) and stylesheets required to alter the basic Kirby setup. Specifically, the stylesheets are:

- responsive
- retina-ready (SVG, vector and text-based assets)

Fonts are served by Typekit. Icon files are contained in SVG or text-based files in the assets folder.

The license and config files have been removed for security and copyright reasons. To obtain your own license, go to the [Kirby CMS homepage](http://getkirby.com).
