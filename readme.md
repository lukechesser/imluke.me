# [imluke.me](http://imluke.me/)

## Description

Source code for my personal site, [imluke.me](http://imluke.me/), using [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com). The old code used [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/) for the backend â€” the code and template for that is somewhere in the past commits.

## Details

This repo contains all of the content (articles, links, projects) components, and stylesheets that I use on imluke.me.

Fonts are served by Typekit. Icons are contained in SVG or text-based files in the assets folder.

## Contact

For more information, feel free to contact me through my site or here on GitHub.
