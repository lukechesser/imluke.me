<blockquote>
  <p>I look at my own design and Instead of being proud that we came this far and that we pushed forward to launch fast, I feel terrible, gutted even, that the design I created is just not good enough. I see flaws and inconsistencies everywhere and canâ€™t help the feeling that I should start all over, from scratch.</p>

<p>I have that feeling all the time when I make things.</p>
