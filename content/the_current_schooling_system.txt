<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the biggest fallacies of the current schooling system, this idea that we&#8217;re all meant to fit nicely into one or two pre-defined categories, regardless of whether or not we actually enjoy doing those things. Worst of all, the categories all happen to coincide with a college degree — something we&#8217;re told from a very early age that we need in order to be successful in life. But there are tens of thousands of categories in the real world, which if you make it anywhere near to the top of, you&#8217;ll be insanely successful.</p>
