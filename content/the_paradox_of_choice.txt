The Paradox of Choice

<blockquote>
  <p>We stand in a room full of doors. As highly curious people, we want to see what is behind every door. This is our desire as artists—to satisfy our curiosity and solve the problems we haven’t previously solved. On some level, however, we know that if we are to drastically reduce our competition and benefit from the resulting power shift, we must pick one door, walk through it and never look back. Our personal desire for variety is suddenly placed at odds with the fundamental need of our business to focus. Is it possible, however, that on the other side of the door we face there is not one long gray hallway, not one empty boring room, but more doors—more choices? Is it possible that what lies on the other side of the door is not the death of our creativity, sure to be snuffed by routine and boredom, but just enough focus to harness the full potential of our talents?</p>
  
  <p>The answer, of course, is that it is possible, but we will never know for sure unless we walk through the door and close it behind us.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.winwithoutpitching.com/sum-of-our-choices" target="_blank">remember reading this book</a> a year ago and it instantly resonated with me. The above is one of my favourite quotes, and one of the most important lessons I&#8217;ve learned.</p>

<p>The whole book is a fantastic read, not just for agencies or clients, but for anyone interested in improving professionally.</p>
