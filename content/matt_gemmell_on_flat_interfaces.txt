<p>Matt Gemmell wrote <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/05/12/tail-wagging/" target="_blank">a great article about <em>true design</em></a>. One of his points stood out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our industry isn’t young anymore, but it’s still full of fear about whether so-called non-technical people will be able to use its products. I think we’ve been trying to get to less adorned, more information-centric interfaces for quite some time, but we’re still making the same tired old arguments from the golden age of human-computer interaction, about how humans need faux three-dimensional cues about the affordances of on-screen objects. Buttons apparently have to look “pushable”, or no-one will push them.</p>

<p>The problem with <em>flat</em> designs isn&#8217;t that interactive elements <strong>have</strong> to look three-dimensional to be understood, it&#8217;s that interactive elements <strong>have</strong> to look different than non-interactive elements. When you remove depth from designs, you remove one more possible tool in distinguishing different elements from each other.</p>
