Microsoft and the Xbox One

<p>I wrote this the other day when drafting an article on problems with the current Xbox 360&#8217;s interface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are 80 million XBox 360 consoles in the world. That&#8217;s a pretty decent number, considering Microsoft has only sold an estimated 5 million Windows 7/8 phones. If I were Microsoft, I&#8217;d double down on the XBox franchise and release a much more usable interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, Wired agrees. In their <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/05/xbox-one/" target="_blank">exclusive look at the Xbox One</a>, they had this to say about the Xbox franchise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At this point, fewer than 2 million Surface tablets have been sold. Windows Phone has a 3.2 percent share of the smartphone market. The Xbox 360, on the other hand, has sold 77 million units and has been the bestselling game console in the US for 28 straight months. Not to take anything away from Microsoft’s other consumer products, but there’s no longer any question which side the company&#8217;s bread is buttered on. And if the Interactive Entertainment Business division gets this right, the Xbox One is going to be a very, very big piece of bread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Microsoft may have just made a huge move, as the new Xbox seems to play to all of their strengths. Good hardware, good software, an established market, reliable cloud services, and good integration with existing services.</p>
