Text: Watches are a big market, yes. But watches aren't tools anymore - they're fashionable accessories. Fashion is a segmented, indomitable market. Apple doesn't operate in indomitable markets. We, tech nerds, may want one, but everyone else is happy with their iPhone and Nixon/TAG Heuer/Swiss/Rolex/Timex/Casio/Omega/.
