Text: The famous 20th-century type designer Frederic W. Goudy on 'novelty':

> There is no harm in 'novelty,' indeed, novelty keeps things fresh and alive; but the novelty which harks back to the extraordinary ugliness of earlier gross and bizarre forms will soon bore and disgust the thinking spectator. Worse yet, is the imitation of novelty quite plainly in evidence among advertisers seeking striking effects. So many of the 'new' offerings are merely old things 'newly' advertised.

In design, it's tempting to take something old and make it new again. A fresh coat of paint, a new look, the newest trends â€“ we rely on novelty to attract attention to our work. Creating true innovation requires pushing past novelty into long-term experience.

Too many designers fall into the trap of novelty. You see it on Dribbble all the time. Quick redesigns based on gradients and type, rather than appreciable, long-term results. 

Look at (link: http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/all-products text: Samsung's current lineup of phones). How can they possibly guarantee a great end-to-end user experience when they ship 152 different phones? That's 152 unique experiences that need to be properly tested. Instead they rely on novelty to attract customers. I know because I once bought a Samsung phone (before I became the Apple fan-boy that I am now). It was cool for all of three days. After that, the every day experience was so shitty that I stopped using my phone altogether.

Novelty is not a substitution for well thought-out design. Unfortunately, it's hard to convince consumers to purchase products that provide long-term results, when novel products provide instant gratification. Similarly, it's even harder to convince management teams to pursue possible long-term gains when smaller short-term gains are guaranteed.
