In Defense of Simplicity

<p>In <a href="http://somerandomdude.com/2011/08/08/defense-hard/" target="_blank">In Defense of Hard</a> PJ Onori questions the oversimplification of interfaces, issues, and software. One quote especially stood out:</p>

<p>If a subject is naturally complex, work to make it no more complex than it needs to be, but no less.</p>

<p>It reminds me of another quote by the famous Astrophysicist and educator <a href="http://twitter.com/neiltyson" target="_blank">Neil Degrasse Tyson</a>. Roughly paraphrased, Neil argues that chemistry, biology, and most other forms of science (I&#8217;m looking at you economics!) over-complicate science by giving new ideas and discoveries complex, fancy-sounding names. But in astrophysics, they name things simply. You can’t see and objects that enter its radius are lost forever? We’ll call it a black hole. It sends out a pulse of intense radiation periodically? We’ll call it a pulsar. </p>

<p>I’ve always loved that about space - how approachable the subjects are. A 6 year-old can read about topics at the forefront of science, how amazing is that? If only all systems and subjects were designed to be as accessible as space. So while I understand PJ’s point of view, and I agree that some products are oversimplified, I think that erring on the side of oversimplification is safer than designing for complexity.</p>
