(link: http://allthingsd.com/20111215/with-siri-tv-apple-will-dismantle-the-tv-networks/ text: Some people popup: yes) speculate that Steve Jobs was talking about a Siri-powered interface here. He's not. As unexciting as it may be to some tech writers, **he's talking about a touch interface**.

I don't pretend to know Apple's plans, nor would I dare to take an accurate guess at how they'll build their interface, but I do know one thing: the main interface will be controlled by a touch-device. Whether it's a cheap iPad Mini that ships with the TV itself, or whether it leverages the ubiquity of existing Apple touch devices like the iPad and iPhone, I know that any successful venture into the TV market by Apple will surely have 1) a drop-dead gorgeous display, 2) revolutionary software, and 3) a touch-device to control the TV.

(link: # text: I outlined some of the quirks and behaviours of TV users) previously, and concluded that **TV behaviour is very similar to the behaviour of users browsing the internet**. As (link: http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/06/20/bilton-creation-consumption text: anyone) (link:http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/microsoft-surface-allows-people-to-create/ text: will) (link:http://macography.net/2012/06/the-ipad-and-the-content-creation-issue/ text: tell) (link:http://www.macfilos.com/home/2012/6/20/ipad-productivity-shortcomings-exposed.html text: you), touch devices are incredible for consuming content. Not only do they make consuming content easy, they're great for navigating and manipulating content.

**Siri, on the other hand, is not made for consuming content.** Voice-input is command-based and relies on queries that have very specific answers. "What was the score of x?", "What's the weather outside?", "Who was the first president of the United States?". They're simple queries that don't require context. "What should I watch today?" is more nuanced. It's heavily based on context. What mood are you in? How much time do you have? Do you want to be entertained or educated?

Not to mention the social aspect of TV. **The majority of TV users will undoubtably use their TV's in a social setting**. Whether it's watching sports with their friends, watching a movie with their partner, or watching a favourite TV show as a family — TV's are social. They have been ever since they were invented and this behaviour will obviously continue. Try using Siri in the middle of a conversation next time you're with your friends. Not only is it awkward to talk to a device, but the interruption of a spunky robot undoubtably ruins the social atmosphere. In the context of a talkative family living-room, how well would the TV be able to hear the voice input unless the room was quiet? If the room wasn't quiet and conversation could continue, how well would the controlling user be able to hear the feedback? How would Siri deal with multiple user inputs?

Voice input just doesn't translate to TV as a primary input device. In some very specific cases it would work, but the majority of the time it would be a huge step backwards. **You wouldn't use Siri to control the internet, and you wouldn't use Siri to control a TV. Touch is the best option — expect to see it when Apple ships**.
