Lowering the bar

<p>There&#8217;s a growing wave of startups trying to take difficult problems in development and simplify them.</p>

<p>I experienced this business model first-hand with our first iteration of <a href="http://ooomf.com" target="_blank">ooomf</a> â€” where we tried to simplify the process of setting up a landing page for iPhone developers. The premise was simple: spend less time worrying about marketing (the stuff you&#8217;re probably not good at), spend more time coding (the stuff you <strong>are</strong> good at). But recently, I&#8217;ve begun to think their might be a fundamental flaw in businesses based on this premise.</p>

<p>When all your product does is lower the bar for entry, your business will most likely fail. I would even go so far as to argue that there are no successful products on the market that <em>only</em> make development easier. Your business model needs to be based on solving another fundamental need. If you can combine another need <em>with</em> a much simpler API, better docs, etc. then you really have a winner.</p>

<p><a href="http://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, for example, dominates the developer payment scene. The usual explanation for their success is that they made a super simple API for developers to accept payments. However, developers will remember that before Stripe existed, writing the code to accept payments was overly complicated <strong>and</strong> getting certified was a bureaucratic nightmare. They both lowered the bar for developers (i.e. any one who knew basic programming could copy and paste some code and Voila! Payments!) <strong>and</strong> they eliminated the convoluted month-long process of being approved to accept payments over the internet.</p>

<p><a href="http://hull.io/" target="_blank">Hull.io</a>, a startup with a very talented team, aims to simplify implementing social experiences in apps. I don&#8217;t mean to pick on any one startup, but I wonder whether they will have success. Undoubtably, their super-simple API lowers the bar for developers, no question. But simply lowering the bar, doesn&#8217;t ensure success. Good developers will jump through hoops to make an idea work; they&#8217;ll navigate bad docs and shitty APIs; they&#8217;ll hack together half-implemented solutions yet magically make it work. Inexperienced developers will take a great API, yet magically, break it. If your startup relies on these developers to build good products using your API, you will most likely fail.</p>

<p>We saw this with ooomf. You could argue that our product wasn&#8217;t fully developed, needed more features, etc. but we no doubt made it super-simple to setup a landing page for your app within a few minutes. What we eventually realized was that no amount of features, design, or UX improvements could reconcile the fact that the <strong>majority of our developers simply weren&#8217;t good enough at building good apps</strong>. If good products weren&#8217;t being built with our product, we had no chance to make it. We had lowered the bar for entry, but that was all we were doing.</p>
