<p>I really like Facebook Search, but from what I&#8217;ve seen of the way my friends use Facebook, none of them have even noticed the change.</p>

<p>My suggestion for Facebook would be to generate search queries on each of the pages that users visit.</p>

<p>Often times that hardest part about designing a new feature is encouraging exploration.</p>
