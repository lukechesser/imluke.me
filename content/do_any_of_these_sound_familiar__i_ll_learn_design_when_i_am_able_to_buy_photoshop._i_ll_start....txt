“<p>Do any of these sound familiar?</p>

<ul><li>I’ll learn design when I am able to buy Photoshop.</li>
<li>I’ll start eating properly when the new diet book arrives.</li>
<li>I’ll start exercising when I get an elliptical.</li>
<li>I would practice guitar more often if I had a better instrument.</li>
<li>I’ll learn to program when I get a new computer.</li>
</ul><p>All of these are just excuses to procrastinate. We think the perfect tool is necessary to complete a task or learn a new skill, but really this is just an easy way to justify our procrastination and desire to spend money.</p>”
