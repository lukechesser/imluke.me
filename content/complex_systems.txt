Complex Systems

<p>A quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/bokardo" target="_blank">Joshua Porter&#8217;s</a> book <a href="http://bokardo.com/book/" target="_blank">Designing for the Social Web</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When working in social, economic, environmental systems, we often assume one action has one result that it will happen relatively soon.</p>
  
  <p>But experience has shown us that we are managing tightly interconnected, delayed, complex systems where one action has multiple, often counterintuitive, results. Delays and perverse effects are common.</p>
  
  <p>Our brains just donâ€™t capture these system features well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The perfect example of this (from <a href="http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/" target="_blank">an article on user agent strings</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then Google built Chrome, and Chrome used Webkit, and it was like Safari, and wanted pages built for Safari, and so pretended to be Safari. And thus Chrome used WebKit, and pretended to be Safari, and WebKit pretended to be KHTML, and KHTML pretended to be Gecko, and all browsers pretended to be Mozilla, and Chrome called itself <em>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.27 Safari/525.13</em>, and the user agent string was a complete mess, and near useless, and everyone pretended to be everyone else, and confusion abounded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have the utmost respect for the guys working on web standards because avoiding this kind of thing again is tremendously hard. Designing the atomic units of complex systems is ridiculously difficult and they do a tremendous job of it. I certainly couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>
