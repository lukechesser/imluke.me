Intrinsic value

<p>The parallels between a company&#8217;s longevity, growth, and eventual demise, and a person&#8217;s happiness, successes, and eventual death, are becoming more obvious to me. There are certain patterns which repeat and scale throughout the Universe, and one of them is this idea of growth and death. All things, including civilizations, companies, and even humanity itself, must eventually end. If nothing can last forever and must end, then what is the point of it?</p>

<p>I think we&#8217;ve all grappled with this question throughout life, but its application to business has only just been considered in the last twenty years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_corporation" target="_blank">B-corp&#8217;s</a> are probably the best example, but companies that consider the well-being of their employees first, their customers second, and their shareholders third, are also important. Companies like <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/" target="_blank">Valve</a> and <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> recognize that the story is the end-goal. The value created along the journey is the only output. Previously, that value would always manifest itself as an absolute: money. In the purely economic sense, that&#8217;s probably a better solution. The most efficient companies — the companies that create the most extrinsic value — are companies that maximize money. But there is a balance between money (an extrinsic value) and employee/customer happiness (an intrinsic value). Exactly what that balance is though is extremely difficult to define.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t think there is a right answer, only a set of possible solutions. Some companies choose to maximize money, other&#8217;s choose to maximize other values.</p>
