“We don’t believe in self-improvement and trying to change your behavior. Instead, we believe that as you discover who you truly are and you let go of the self-destructive patterns and fears that keeps you away from that, you will find that you add an extreme amount of value in the most natural and effortless way possible. And that’s going to lead to both success, a meaningful contribution, and a deep sense of fulfillment. Don’t try to mold yourself into some imagined ideal. Find out who you already are and become it.”
